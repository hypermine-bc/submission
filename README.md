## Overview

Since the beginning of the software era; there is an ongoing struggle for eliminating copyright infringement. Associations such as the BSA [Business Software Alliance], WIPO [World Intellectual Property Organization] and laws such as the DMCA [Digital Millennium Copyright Act] amongst others, have been working hard to:

• Control piracy • Promote original content • Reward content creators • Advocate the legitimate trade of pre-owned media

Adhat will solve these challenges by creating a decentralized ecosystem that will allow users to create truly unique and individual content, reward creators for their work and finally allow users to trade pre-owned media between them whilst protecting and rewarding the content creators.
